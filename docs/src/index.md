## Goal

The goal of the package `JToric` is to make computations on toric geometry accessible in the [OSCAR computer algebra system](https://oscar.computeralgebra.de/). As such, we follow [the book](https://www.ams.org/publications/authors/books/postpub/gsm-124) `Toric Varieties` by `David A. Cox`, `John B. Little` and `Henry K. Schenck`]. Currently, this project is work-in-progress. Our goal is to ensure that one can perform all computations of `Appendix B`.
